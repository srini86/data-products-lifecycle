-- Add comment to the semantic view with official definitions
COMMENT ON SEMANTIC VIEW retail_customer_churn_risk_sv IS 
'Retail Customer Churn Risk Data Product - Semantic View for Cortex Analyst.
Contract Version: 1.0.0 | Owner: alex.morgan@bank.com | SLA: Daily refresh by 6 AM UTC

RISK TIER DEFINITIONS (Official):
- CRITICAL (76-100): Immediate intervention required, highest churn probability
- HIGH (51-75): Proactive retention outreach needed
- MEDIUM (26-50): Monitor closely, early warning signals
- LOW (0-25): Healthy customer relationship

ELIGIBILITY FLAGS:
- declining_balance_flag: Balance < £500 OR primary account < £100
- reduced_activity_flag: Transactions down >30% vs prior period
- low_engagement_flag: <3 logins in 30d AND no mobile app
- complaint_flag: Open complaint OR 2+ complaints in 12 months
- dormancy_flag: No transactions in 45+ days (strongest indicator)

Example questions:
- How many customers are at risk (HIGH or CRITICAL)?
- Show me critical risk customers in the South East region
- What percentage of customers have the dormancy flag?
- Which region has the most declining balance customers?';
